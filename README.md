## Introduction

**Datastructures and Algorithms in Java**

In order to make full use of java, I try my utmost to implement the design patterns and design code structure.

In the meanwhile, code's efficiency and concise are guaranteed, as well as the sufficient notes.

```
                               
 ____    ______       _____    
/\  _`\ /\  _  \  __ /\___ \   
\ \ \/\ \ \ \L\ \/\_\\/__/\ \  
 \ \ \ \ \ \  __ \/\ \  _\ \ \ 
  \ \ \_\ \ \ \/\ \ \ \/\ \_\ \
   \ \____/\ \_\ \_\ \_\ \____/
    \/___/  \/_/\/_/\/_/\/___/ 
                               
```

> Attention: The [DAiJ](https://github.com/QAQddbest/DAiJ) is used for **educational purposes**, which means less efficiency than the standard library and should not directly be used in your works.

## Contribution

:cry:Maybe I will add this part later.

## Thanks

Thanks to [TheAlgorithms/Java](https://github.com/TheAlgorithms/Java) in github.

I consult it's structure(and only the structure, never the code), and [README.md](https://github.com/TheAlgorithms/Java/blob/master/README.md) file.
